# CS3090-Block-2-Project

Author: Tristen Talbert

This repository contains code that I am proud of writing during my career at the University of Utah. It will include my senior capstone project, as well as some other personal code projects I have written. The purpose of this repository is to show my skills in software engineering to future employers, and hopefully assist in accessing a career after graduation.
